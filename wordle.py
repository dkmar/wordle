''' Gameplay (Hard Mode)
1. Initial state has the target word.
2. We play up to six rounds wherein we can make a guess and get feedback.
The best guess is based on our knowledge, which is our cumulative feedback.
We want to score guess candidates.
The score of a guess =
    sum of (pattern probability * pattern information)
Our guess candidates consist of the remaining wordset.

Given our feedback, I want to return a top k of guess candidates

We play a word from the wordset.
We get feedback, this feedback prunes the wordset.
We want to choose the next word
- score candidates by how much they would prune the wordset
    - maybe lets have the wordset be a list of words
    - and every pruned wordset be a list of indices for candidate words
    OK this doesn't work cause you're using the answer to score candidates...
    which is cheating lol. We need to estimate the value of a word from all
    possible feedbacks we could get from using it.
- keep the top k candidates (for reporting)
repeat by playing a candidate
